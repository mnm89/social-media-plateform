# User service

## Define the User Service Requirements

- **CRUD Operations**: The user service should allow for basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for user profiles.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Only authenticated users should be able to access certain endpoints, with specific permissions for actions like updating or deleting user profiles.
- **Data Schema**: We’ll define a schema to represent profile details, such as `id`, `bio`, `address`, `phone`, and `user_id`.

## Set Up the Service Structure

- **Routes**: Define routes like  `GET /profile`,  `PUT /profile` , `DELETE /profile`.
- **Middleware**: `keycloak-connect` to enforce authentication on protected routes, `getProfile` Middleware to retrieve or create a profile
- **Database Integration**: using a database (e.g. PostgreSQL), set up the connection and model schema for storing profile data.

## Implement Security and Permissions

- Use Keycloak roles to restrict access to certain endpoints .
- Ensure each endpoint validates that the request includes a valid JWT.

## Set Up Docker for the User Service

- Define a Dockerfile and Docker Compose configuration for the user service if it’s a separate microservice.
- Connect it to the network so it can communicate with the API Gateway and Keycloak.
